Brushing upon ML skills


### NaiveBayesian.ipynb
*  Introduction to Naive Bayes as a probabilistic classifier. 
*  Implemented a simple Naive Bayes classifier using categorical likelihoods.

### LogisticRegression.ipynb
*  Introduction to binary classification and the sigmoid function. 
*  Binary Cross-Entropy Loss: Overview of binary cross-entropy and its role in penalizing incorrect classifications. 
*  Gradient Descent: Implemented gradient descent to optimize weights in Logistic Regression. 
*  L2 Regularization: Added L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and explored the impact of regularization strength.

### Churn Data/LogisticRegression.ipynb
*  Using real-world churn data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). 
*  Encoding Categorical Data: Explored Label Encoding vs. One-Hot Encoding, and implemented both. 
*  Logistic Regression with Categorical Encoding: Compared the performance of one-hot vs. label-encoded data.
